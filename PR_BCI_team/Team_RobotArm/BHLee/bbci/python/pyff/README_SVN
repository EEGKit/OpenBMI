This our (BBCI) private version of pyff's repository.

The public one is hosted at 

  pyff.googlecode.com

This one should only contain stuff which we don't want or cannot publish at 
googlecode.

Some stuff will always stay here, while other stuff will start here and move
over to googlecode once the papers are written.
