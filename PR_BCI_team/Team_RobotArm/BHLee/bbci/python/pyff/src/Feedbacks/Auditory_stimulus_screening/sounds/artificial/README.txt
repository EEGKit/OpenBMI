There are 3 pitches: high, medium and low 
--> Same sounds as in the spacialP300 experiment by Martijn: soundIDs 3(high), 1(medium) and 6(low)


meaning of suffix 4-6:
*4 are short (40ms) sounds, *5, *6 and *7 are long (100ms) sounds
all sounds except of *7 are mixed with white noise!
In *4 and *6, the lateral sounds are more extreme, meaning that the right sound is more to the right than in *5 !
