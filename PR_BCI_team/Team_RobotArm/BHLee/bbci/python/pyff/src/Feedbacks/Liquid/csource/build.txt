I built this under Windows with SWIG 1.3.31 and MINGW-GCC. It should compile on any other platform where SWIG and gcc are available. The python library and include paths in the compilation may have to be adjusted to match your system.

The name of the output file will be slightly changed (to .so instead of .pyd) on Linux systems. However this should still be loaded correctly by Python if the library is in the Python path.
