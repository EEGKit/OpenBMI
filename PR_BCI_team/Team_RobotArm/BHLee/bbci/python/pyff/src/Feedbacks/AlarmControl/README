Copyspeller
===========

Configurable variables an their meaning:

* cs_duration [sec]: Duration of the Copyspeller task. The copyspeller task
  will quit automatically after the given time.
* t_copyspeller [sec]: When to start the copyspeller. If the value is equal or
  smaller 0, the copyspeller task is not scheduled at all.
* can_stop_on_control_signal [bool]: If True a control signal can interrupt the
  copyspeller task, if set to false, the copyspeller task is always perfomed
  until cd_duration.
  A negative value in the control signal will be interpreted as an unrecognized
  ERP and stop the copyspeller task, a positive number will be ignored.

Other variables:

* do_2 [bool]: If set to True, do the D2 task, otherwise do the copyspeller.
  This variable has to be set directly in the source code!
